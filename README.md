# Week2-Project
# This program predicts stock price using four machine learning regression models<br>
# 1) Creates a .csv file with historical data of the stock<br>
# 2) Calculates and plots stock's Rolling Mean/Moving Average, stock Return rate, high-low %, % change<br>
# 3) Performs/plots Linear Regression, predicts stock price, calculates rmse, coefficients, variance/confidence<br>
# 4) Performs/plots Ridge Regression, predicts stock price, calculates rmse, coefficients, variance/confidence<br>
# 5) Performs/plots Lasso Regression, predicts stock price, calculates rmse, coefficients, variance/confidence<br>
# 6) Performs/plots KNN Regression, predicts stock price, calculates rmse, variance/confidence<br>
